# DETOXIS DEtection of TOXicity in comments In Spanish

## Introduction

The DETOXIS (DEtection of TOxicity in comments In Spanish) task will take place as part of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/iberlef2021/organization" rel="nofollow">IberLEF 2021</a>, the 3rd Workshop on Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum at the SEPLN 2021 Conference, which will be held in September 2021 in Spain.

The aim of the DETOXIS task is the detection of toxicity in comments posted in Spanish in response to different online news articles related to immigration. The DETOXIS task is divided into two related classification subtasks: Toxicity detection task and Toxicity level detection task

The presence of toxic messages on social media and the need to identify and mitigate them leads to the development of systems for their automatic detection. The automatic detection of toxic language, especially in tweets and comments, is a task that has attracted growing interest from the NLP community in recent years.

DETOXIS is the first task that focuses on the detection of different levels of toxicity in comments posted in response to news articles written in Spanish.
